# PHP-VUE-SSR

This is example of Vue.js Server Side Rendering in PHP

based on 
https://github.com/spatie/server-side-rendering

## Installation
```bash
npm install
composer install --no-interaction --no-progress --prefer-dist
docker compose up
```

It starts on port 80, so if port 80 is busy on your machine, you may want to change the port number in docker-compose.
